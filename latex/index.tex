Py\+AMA is a desktop application for displaying TIFF stacks of single-\/cell microscopy images and for reading out single-\/cell time courses of the cell area and the fluorescence intensity.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsubsection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
Python 3.\+8 with {\ttfamily tkinter} is required.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxyparagraph{Anaconda users}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
If you are using \href{https://www.anaconda.com}{\texttt{ Anaconda}}, you can install the dependencies with the following command, which will create a new environment called {\ttfamily pyama} and install all necessary packages (untested yet)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{conda env create -\/f environment.yml}
\DoxyCodeLine{conda activate pyama}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxyparagraph{Pip users}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
If you prefer using venv/pip, you can use this command (if you use bash; otherwise, you may have to adapt the commands accordingly)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir env}
\DoxyCodeLine{python -\/m venv env}
\DoxyCodeLine{source env/bin/activate}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip install git+https://github.com/SoftmatterLMU-\/RaedlerGroup/pyama.git\#egg=pyama}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxyparagraph{Desktop file installation for Linux users (experimental)}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Linux users can create an application menu entry for Py\+AMA by adjusting the Exec path in the file {\ttfamily pyama.\+desktop} and creating a symlink to (or copying) {\ttfamily pyama.\+desktop} in either {\ttfamily /usr/share/applications} (for global installation) or {\ttfamily $\sim$/.local/share/applications} (for user-\/specific installation).\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxyparagraph{Starting Py\+AMA}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
Make sure that the environment containing Py\+AMA is activated. You can then start Py\+AMA by executing\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{python -\/m pyama}

\end{DoxyCode}


or simply\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pyama}

\end{DoxyCode}


Upon starting Py\+AMA, an empty window opens.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxyparagraph{Loading a stack}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
To open a stack, click on “\+Open stack…” (or, alternatively\+: “\+File/\+Open stack…”). A stack selection dialog is displayed. By clicking on “\+Open”, you can load a TIFF stack. On the right side of the dialog, you can compose your analysis stack from the channels of multiple files. To add a channel to the analysis stack, select the corresponding file on the left side of the dialog, then specify the channel, type and optional label of the channel on the right side and finally, click on “\+Add”.

The channel is the number of the channel in the selected file. This requires that you know in which order the channels are arranged in your file.

The type of the channel is one of the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item “\+Phase contrast”\+: The channel is a phase contrast image. It is only displayed for your ~\newline
 orientation.
\item “\+Fluorescence”\+: The channel contains fluorescence images. This channel will be used ~\newline
 for fluorescence readout.
\item “\+Segmentation”\+: The channel contains a binary image indicating the cells as ~\newline
 non-\/zero areas. This channel will be used to detect and track the cells and ~\newline
 integrate the fluorescence over the cells. ~\newline


Technical note\+: Each cluster of 1-\/connected (4-\/neighborhood) non-\/zero pixels is treated ~\newline
 as one cell. To be trackable, the contours of a cell must overlap in subsequent frames. ~\newline
 Contours below a threshold are ignored.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The optional label is only used for documenting the stack and has no effect on the fluorescence readout. For example, you can label a fluorescence channel as GFP to distinguish it from other fluorescence channels.

When all channels are specified, click on “\+OK” to load the stack. Depending on the stacks you specified, this may take some time, but the loading progress is shown in the status line.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxyparagraph{Viewing the stack}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
You can review the stack by selecting the channel to display, by scrolling through the frames using the slider below the stack, and by highlighting single cells.

You can highlight a cell by clicking on the cell in the image or on a corresponding trace in the plot axes.

To exclude or include a cell in the readout, select/deselect it by clicking on the cell in the image with the shift key pressed. You can also (de)select highlighted cells with the enter key.

You can also use the up/down arrow keys to scroll through the cells, the left/right arrow keys to scroll through the frames, and the number keys to change the displayed channel. Use Ctrl + left/right arrow to scroll 10 frames at once and Home/\+End to jump to the first/last frame.

When all cells to be read out are specified, click on “\+File/\+Save” to save the measurements. Note that highlighted cells will also be highlighted in the plot in the PDF file.

When saving the measurements, a file {\ttfamily session.\+zip} is generated. You can reload the measurement by clicking on “\+File/\+Load session” and selecting this file. Currently, this requires that the stack files are all located in the same directories as during the session that created the file.
