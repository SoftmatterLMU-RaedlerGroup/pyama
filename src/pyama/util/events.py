class Event:
    """Container for sharing callable events between threads.

Constructor arguments:
cmd -- str indicating a command for consumer, or function to be called by consumer
args, kwargs -- arguments and keyword arguments with which command/function is called
One of 'cmd' and 'fun' must be given. If 'fun' is given, 'cmd' is ignored.

Properties:
cmd -- the 'cmd' as received by constructor
time -- monotonic time of instantiation
called -- boolean flag; True iff this instance has been called already

To execute the event, call the event like a function. If the constructor
argument 'cmd' is not callable, the call requires a callable as 'fun' argument.

The 'Event' class provides a mechanism to prevent unnecessary calls of
events that have been deprecated by a more recent event.
To use the mechanism, simply provide the latest allowed time as
'not_after' argument to the call. The time must be compatible to the
value returned by the 'now' method.
The call returns False if it would have been unnecessary, else True.

This class is not thread-safe. Once fed into a queue, it should not be
modified by the producer anymore.
